	TAGS

-Element names are surrounded by angeled brackets (< body >)
-Tag elements normally come on pairs (<xxx>) (< followed by / to initate "end",,,>
-select tags close themselves
-Head (tag) is used to connect java script file, set title
-There are 6 heading tags, mainly (1,2)
-h1 for main headings, h2 for sub headings

	INLINE VS BLOCK ELEMENTS

-Block elements start on a new line and take the full width availble to page (david-----------------------)
-example of block level elements(<p> (tag))				     (david-----------------------)
-Inline elements do NOT start on a new line and only take the width necessary(ex, <button>(tag))
-inline elemnets ex(321, 321 321)
-Block level elements (<div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>
-inline elemnets (<span>, <a>, <button>xxx</button> <b> 
-anchor tag to link website a href
-target=_blank to open in new tab
-to link website you NEED "https://"
